Hello

This is my calculator project as part of the Odin Project Course.

I had so much fun building this one and really felt like the basics of javascript were all coming together. Most of the time I was able to figure out any debugging problems first time, which makes a difference from the projects before.

It was definitely a challenge trying to work out how get the operate() function to work without using eval(), but once I had learnt how the window scope worked it turned out to be an easy fix!
